# PRODIGY_DS_02 - Task 2: Students Performance Analysis

This project demonstrates **basic data exploration and visualization** using Python.  
We analyzed student performance using charts to understand trends in scores and demographics.

## Dataset
- `StudentsPerformance.csv` → Dataset used for analysis
- Source: Public dataset containing student exam scores and demographics

## Jupyter Notebook
- `PRODIGY_DS_02.ipynb` → Contains code, visualizations, and insights

## Visualizations
1. **Histogram of Math Scores** – Shows distribution of math scores across students  
2. **Histogram of Reading Scores** – Shows distribution of reading scores  
3. **Bar Chart of Students by Gender** – Count of male vs female students  
4. **Bar Chart of Students by Parental Level of Education** – Count based on parental education

## Libraries Used
- `pandas` for data manipulation  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for visualization

## Insights
- Most students scored between 60–80 in math and reading  
- The dataset has almost equal numbers of male and female students  
- Students with parents having higher education levels tend to score slightly better
